Hi, I'm Zach!

I enjoy solving business problems with code and data, automating things that can be automated, and a good cup of hot tea.

I work for [H-E-B](https://heb.com) in Customer Data Analytics as a Decision Science Analyst.

## Open Source Projects

Check out my repositories for more, but here's several that I'm particularly fond of:

- [`cods`](https://github.com/zgulde/cods): a bunch of shell scripting that automates the setup of virtual hosting and git push deployment on digital ocean droplets
- [`zgulde-python`](https://github.com/zgulde/zgulde-python): a grab-bag of python code I've found useful
- [`markdown-to-anki`](https://github.com/zgulde/markdown-to-anki): a small little command line tool to convert markdown documents to [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards
- [`hlre`](https://github.com/zgulde/hlre): a TUI application for developing python regular expressions with a tight feedback loop
- [`makefile-tutorial`](https://github.com/zgulde/makefile-tutorial): a bite-sized introduction to Makefiles. A sequence of small short lessons with practice exercises to teach how Makefiles work
